## Overview

### The assessment

Create a simple WordPress Plugin with the following jQuery functionalities:

- After a user is idle on any page/post for 10 seconds, display an overlay with a clock and the current date on the screen.
- If the user is logged into the WordPress site (using regular username/password credentials), display the userâ€™s name and email address underneath the clock.

## My process

- Including plugins for user registration, login and user profiles.
- Created a directory and 2 files(php and js) to test plugin being triggered correctly.
- Update php and JS files, adding functionality(clock, reset triggers and update) in js and localize function + hook in php.
- Added conditional to show user information, created css file with styling for the overlay and enqueued styling file in php file
- Checked for corrections, used html semantic structure for the overlay, added more comments to the code and looked in to responsiveness.

### Built with

1. Deeper understanding of Wordpress infrastructure, for a better understanding certian 
2. Code optimization and refactoring
3.
